## Introduction

This documentation provides a detailed explanation of the code structure and functionality of the Student Management System. The system is designed to manage student records, academic information, and extracurricular activities through a console-based interface.

## Class Structure

The system is organized around three main classes:

1. **StudentManagementSystem** - The base class that contains common functionality
2. **Admin** - Inherits from StudentManagementSystem, handles administrative functions
3. **Student** - Inherits from StudentManagementSystem, handles student-related functions

## StudentManagementSystem Class

The base class that provides common functionality for both admin and student interfaces.

### Attributes

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.userfile = "user.txt"
    self.personalfile = 'personal.txt'
    self.gradefile = "grades.txt"
    self.ecafile = "eca.txt" 
    self.adminfile = "admin_password.txt"
    self.studentfile = "student_password.txt"
    self.cfm_student = "confrom_student.txt"
    self.username = None
    self.password = None
    self.verify = None
    self.goback = False
    self.no_unique = False
```

- `userfile`: Stores basic student information (ID, name, class, section)
- `personalfile`: Stores detailed student personal information
- `gradefile`: Stores student grades
- `ecafile`: Stores extracurricular activities
- `adminfile`: Stores admin credentials
- `studentfile`: Stores student credentials
- `cfm_student`: Stores verification data
- `username`: Stores current username during login/signup
- `password`: Stores current password during login/signup
- `verify`: Stores verification ID during signup/authentication
- `goback`: Flag to handle navigation
- `no_unique`: Flag to check uniqueness of IDs

### Methods

#### `timer(self, seconds)`
Pauses execution for the specified number of seconds.

#### `clscr(self)`
